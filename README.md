# Install GoShimmer for Pollen testnet using one command

You can use this one line command to get a routine that will perform the installation of GoShimmer. Login to your VPS and ruin the command bellow. This shell script has been tested in Ubuntu 20.04. 


The following commands will download and run an install.sh script with all steps needed to install GoShimmer according to the guide at [IOTA Foundation repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/wiki/Setup-up-a-GoShimmer-node-(Joining-the-pollen-testnet)). 

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demichele/install-goshimmer/master/install.sh && chmod 0777 install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Once the process finnishes you will be able to access your Node Dashboard at:

```
http://your-ip:8081
```

I will be updating the commands to reflect the installation recommended by the IOTA Foundation
